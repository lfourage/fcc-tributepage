            Genet was a French novelist, playwright, poet, essayist, and
            political activist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Born in 1910 from a prostitute mother, he was placed for adoption
            and grew up in the provincial town of Alligny-en-Morvan, in the
            Nièvre department of central France.
          </p>
          <p>
            His foster family was a caring one, and he received good grades in
            school, but he was involved in petty theft and attempts of running
            away, wich led to him being sent to a correctional facility from his
            15 to 18.
          </p>
          <p>
            He joined the Foreign Legion but was given a dishonorable discharge
            for indecency, having been caught engaged in a homosexual act.
          </p>
          <p>
            He spent a period as a vagabond, petty thief and prostitute across
            Europe, wich you can read about in
            <cite>Le Journal du Voleur</cite> (1949).
          </p>
          <p>
            He eventualy returned to Paris where he went in and out of prison
            for various offences. In prison he wrote his first poem (<cite
              >Le condamné à mort</cite
            >), and his first novel (<cite>Notre Dame des Fleurs</cite>, 1944).
          </p>
          <p>
            He then met
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Cocteau"
              >Jean Cocteau</a
            >
            who was impressed by his writing. This connection allowed him to be
            published, and later saved him from a life sentence, thanks to a
            petition including among others Cocteau, Sartre and Picasso,
            convincing the French President to have the sentence set aside.
            Genet would never return to prison.
          </p>
          <p>
            His writings were controversial, because they often included very
            explicit and provocative portrayals of homosexuality and
            criminality.
          </p>
          <p>
            He became politicaly active around the late 1960s. He participated
            in demonstrations drawing attention to the living conditions of
            immigrants in France.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1970 he was invited by the

            and stayed three months with them, giving lectures, attenting trials
            and publishing articles in their journals. He later that year spent
            six months in Palestinian refugee camps, secretly meeting

            <cite>Un Captif Amoureux</cite>, wich would be published after his
            death.
          </p>

            Genet also supported

            In 1982, he was in Beirut when

            occured. Having visited Shatila after the event, he published
            <cite>Quatre heures à Chatila</cite>.
          </p>
          <p>
            On 15 April 1986, Genet was found dead in his hotel room, in Paris.
            He had developed a throat cancer and he is believed to have fallen
            on the floor, fatally hitting his head. He is now resting in the
            Larache Christian Cemetery, in Morocco.
