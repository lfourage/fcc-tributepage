# fcc-tributepage

## Utility
This project serves as an evaluation for previously learned HTML/CSS concepts.

## Context
Fcc Tribute Page is a certification project from the Responsive Web Design course on [freecodecamp.org]([https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-survey-form-project/build-a-survey-form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-tribute-page-project/build-a-tribute-page)).
The aim is to create a tribute page with style using previously learned concepts in HTML/CSS.

### Instructions

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to [https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks](https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks). Do not copy this demo project.

    Your tribute page should have a main element with a corresponding id of main, which contains all other elements
    You should see an element with an id of title, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")
    You should see either a figure or a div element with an id of img-div
    Within the #img-div element, you should see an img element with a corresponding id="image"
    Within the #img-div element, you should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in #img-div
    You should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page
    You should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab
    Your #image should use max-width and height properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size
    Your img element should be centered within its parent element

Note: Be sure to add <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> in your HTML to link your stylesheet and apply your CSS


##  Usage
Simply open "index.html" with a web browser and with "styles.css" in the same directory.
